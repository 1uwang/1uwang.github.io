<p>The website is established with the aim to introduce my research experience to supplement the brief description on my resume. 
What I've done before would be shown in a style of blog, clearly categorized by time and tags.</p>
    
<p>Currently I'm a first year master student in Environmental Studies with the focus on Soil and water microbiology. 
My background is actually really diverse because my courses involve chemistry, geography, biology, and modelling, etc. 
Environmental issues often require a multi-perspective and interdisciplinary approach to solve. 
Personally speaking, leading technologies and deeper digging are also important for scientific research, which is what I strive for.</p>     

<p>My research interest is on microbial interactions with the environment in terms of the soil, water and plant systems. 
  Furthermore, I'm very much like to explore more about the gene functions of various bacteria,
   especially regarding to the metabolism process (biosynthesis and biodegradation). Developing and adopting promising biotechnologies
 to confront the environmental crisis and achieve a sustainable future is the objective of my work.</p>

<p>I am an organized and independent person, but I am also easy to get along with and a good team player.
   I am very open to exploring unknown areas that appeal to me and can learn relevant knowledge quickly.
  I am a marine enthusiast and am passionate in everything about the sea.</p>
